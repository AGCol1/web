        <h1>Christ the Redeemer</h1>
        <p>Christ the Redeemer is an iconic statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was completed in 1931 and stands at 30 meters (98 feet) tall, not including its 8-meter (26 feet) pedestal. The arms of the statue stretch 28 meters (92 feet) wide.</p>
        <p>The statue is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone and is located at the peak of the 700-meter (2,300 feet) Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca Forest National Park, overlooking the city of Rio de Janeiro. It is a symbol of Christianity across the world and has become a cultural icon of both Rio de Janeiro and Brazil.</p>
        <p>Christ the Redeemer was designed by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa and created by French sculptor Paul Landowski. The face of the statue was created by Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida.</p>
        <p>In 2007, Christ the Redeemer was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a global poll conducted by the New7Wonders Foundation.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The idea of constructing a large statue atop Corcovado mountain was first suggested in the mid-1850s, when Vincentian priest Pedro Maria Boss requested financing from Princess Isabel to build a large religious monument. The request was dismissed in 1889 when Brazil became a republic with laws mandating the separation of church and state.</p>
        <p>The second proposal for a landmark statue on the mountain was made in 1920 by the Catholic Circle of Rio. The group organized an event called Semana do Monumento (Monument Week) to attract donations and collect signatures to support the building of the statue. The donations came mostly from Brazilian Catholics.</p>
        <p>The statue's construction took nine years, from 1922 to 1931, and it was inaugurated on October 12, 1931. The monument was opened to the public on October 12, 1931, and has since become a major tourist attraction, drawing millions of visitors each year.</p>
