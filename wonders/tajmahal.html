    <h1>About Taj Mahal</h1>
    <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.</p>
    <p>The construction of the Taj Mahal was completed in 1653, employing thousands of artisans and craftsmen. The chief architect was Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. The Taj Mahal is considered the finest example of Mughal architecture, a blend of Indian, Persian, and Islamic styles. It is one of the most admired masterpieces of the world's heritage and attracts millions of tourists every year.</p>
    <p>The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage." It remains a symbol of India's rich history and is often regarded as a symbol of love due to the romantic story behind its construction.</p>
    <p>The Taj Mahal's construction involved the use of materials from all over India and Asia. Over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials. The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China. Turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia. In all, twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.</p>
    <p>The Taj Mahal complex is bordered on three sides by red sandstone walls, with the river-facing side left open. Outside the walls are several additional mausoleums, including those of Shah Jahan's other wives, and a larger tomb for Mumtaz's favorite servant. The main gateway (darwaza) is a monumental structure built primarily of marble, and it is reminiscent of Mughal architecture of earlier emperors. The garden is set out in the classical Mughal charbagh pattern, a quadrilateral garden divided by walkways or flowing water into four smaller parts.</p>
    <p>In recent years, the Taj Mahal has faced several threats, including pollution, which has caused the white marble to turn yellow. Efforts have been made to reduce the impact of pollution, including the use of mud-pack therapy to clean the marble. Despite these challenges, the Taj Mahal continues to be a symbol of India's rich history and a testament to the enduring power of love.</p>
