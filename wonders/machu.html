        <h1>Machu Picchu</h1>
        <p>Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a mountain
            ridge 2,430 meters (7,970 ft) above sea level. It is located in the Machupicchu District within Urubamba
            Province above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cuzco. The Urubamba River
            flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain climate.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti
            (1438â€“1472). Often mistakenly referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is the most familiar icon of
            Inca civilization. The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later at the time of
            the Spanish Conquest. Although known locally, it was not known to the Spanish during the colonial period and
            remained unknown to the outside world until American historian Hiram Bingham brought it to international
            attention in 1911.</p>

    <div class="machu-box" <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary
            structures are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows. Most of the
            outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of what the structures
            originally looked like. By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues.

    <h2>Tourism</h2>
    <p>Machu Picchu is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was declared a Peruvian Historical Sanctuary in 1981 and a World
        Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983. In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a
        worldwide Internet poll. The site is a popular tourist attraction, with many visitors traveling to Peru to see
        the ancient ruins.</p>
